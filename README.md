# Safeguards

All VizDoom experiments in this paper are conducted using [SampleFactory](https://github.com/alex-petrenko/sample-factory) on a Ryzen 7 5800X CPU and an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU.

## Setup

Please follow the instructions on the SampleFactory page to set up the framework (installing VizDoom, and dependencies of SampleFactory).

## Running Experiments

To reproduce the baseline, zero shot, and safeguarded results, use `run_trial.sh`.

Please keep in mind that running all of the trials will take several hours depending on your hardware.
